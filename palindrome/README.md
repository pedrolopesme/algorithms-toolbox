# Palindrome


### Description

Implements an efficient way to check if a given String is a palindrome.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which 
reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar. 
Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for 
adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as 
"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!", "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" or "No 'x' in Nixon".


### Input

A regular string, containing a word or a sentence

### Output

Ex:  A boolean, indicating if the input was a palindrome


### Requirements

This algorithm should have a complexity better than or equals to O(n), 
where _n_ is the length of the given String


### Makefile

This project provides a Makefile with all common operations need to develop, 
test and build the binary.

* build: generates binaries
* test: runs all tests
* clean: removes binaries
* run: executes main func
* fmt: runs gofmt for all go files

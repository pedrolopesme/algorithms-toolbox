# Insertion Sort


### Description

In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) 
is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. 
Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the implementation 
preserves the input order of equal elements in the sorted output. Merge sort 
is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945.

A detailed description and analysis of bottom-up mergesort appeared in a 
report by Goldstine and von Neumann as early as 1948.

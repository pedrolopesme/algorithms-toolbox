# Linked List


### Description

In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements, 
whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. 
Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a 
collection of nodes which together represent a sequence. In its most basic form, 
each node contains: data, and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node 
in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements
 from any position in the sequence during iteration.
